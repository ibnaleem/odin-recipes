[This project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) aims to create a collection of recipes using HTML. [The project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) is divided into iterations, with each iteration adding new features and improving the overall structure of the recipe collection.

## Iteration 1: Initial Structure
In this iteration, an initial structure is set up for the recipe collection. An [`index.html`](https://github.com/ibnaleem/odin-recipes/blob/main/index.html) file is created with basic HTML boilerplate code. The file includes an [`<h1>`](https://github.com/ibnaleem/odin-recipes/commit/da1f05f533529d43910ff91565da2f53be23d2db) heading with the title ["Odin Recipes."](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes)

## Iteration 2: Recipe Page
The second iteration focuses on creating a recipe page template. A new directory named [`/recipes`](https://github.com/ibnaleem/odin-recipes/tree/main/recipes) is created within the project directory. Inside this directory, an HTML file is created for each recipe, named after the dish it contains. For example, [`lasagna.html`](https://github.com/ibnaleem/odin-recipes/blob/main/recipes/lasagna.html) can be used as a template for a lasagna recipe.

The [`index.html`](https://github.com/ibnaleem/odin-recipes/blob/main/index.html) file is updated to include links to the recipe pages. Each recipe link is added under the ["Odin Recipes"](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) heading using the [`<a>`](https://github.com/ibnaleem/odin-recipes/commit/99e5b85be432e0c0b64dea768530c223b07569ba) tag.

## Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content
In this iteration, the recipe pages are enhanced with more content. Each recipe page should include the following:

- [An image of the finished dish.](https://github.com/ibnaleem/odin-recipes/commit/d18a34e91c1e2bf9a8bdd155fe511ddab9ec4083)
- [A "Description" heading](https://github.com/ibnaleem/odin-recipes/commit/af92ebb26c0c93ac7f08a67acb87da81a52e33f6) followed by [a paragraph or two describing the recipe.](https://github.com/ibnaleem/odin-recipes/commit/d575be40a29177c8c172a017e5f6a8328878e20c)
- [An "Ingredients" heading](https://github.com/ibnaleem/odin-recipes/commit/466a081810c44aeea866f186968eb7bd471d3ae5) followed by [an unordered list of the ingredients needed for the recipe.](https://github.com/ibnaleem/odin-recipes/commit/7dd630276ed3e438c4f8db21a1424027297b4102)
- [A "Steps" heading](https://github.com/ibnaleem/odin-recipes/commit/6dc95f39c40f7fee51a09829c458ec014681fba6) followed by [an ordered list of the steps needed to make the dish.](https://github.com/ibnaleem/odin-recipes/commit/562165b271b9450519374dda4de292f8e012878f)

## Iteration 4: Add More Recipes
The final iteration involves adding two more recipes to the collection. These recipes should follow the same page structure as the existing recipe page. The [`index.html`](https://github.com/ibnaleem/odin-recipes/blob/main/index.html) file should be updated to include links to the newly added recipes. Consider using an unordered list to organize the recipe links and prevent them from appearing on a single line.

Once the project is completed, the following skills will be demonstrated:

- [Creating a basic HTML structure.](https://github.com/ibnaleem/odin-recipes/commit/1fce40b1b7149d0929e958583de46fc167339021)
- [Linking between pages using HTML.](https://github.com/ibnaleem/odin-recipes/commit/99e5b85be432e0c0b64dea768530c223b07569ba)
- [Adding and displaying images.](https://github.com/ibnaleem/odin-recipes/commit/d18a34e91c1e2bf9a8bdd155fe511ddab9ec4083)
- Structuring content with [headings](https://github.com/ibnaleem/odin-recipes/commit/6bae072a8beb572b67e737bd0acfe4f93639453e) and [paragraphs.](https://github.com/ibnaleem/odin-recipes/commit/d575be40a29177c8c172a017e5f6a8328878e20c)
- Creating lists for [ingredients](https://github.com/ibnaleem/odin-recipes/commit/7dd630276ed3e438c4f8db21a1424027297b4102) and [steps.](https://github.com/ibnaleem/odin-recipes/commit/562165b271b9450519374dda4de292f8e012878f)
- [Organizing content within directories.](https://github.com/ibnaleem/odin-recipes/commit/6f6bd2bce72046346e3a7e108ead51deff082b65)

This project provides a foundation for building a more advanced recipe collection, with the possibility of adding additional features such as search functionality, responsive design, and interactive elements.
