[This project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) aims to create a collection of recipes using HTML. [The project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) is divided into iterations, with each iteration adding new features and improving the overall structure of the recipe collection.

## Iteration 1: Initial Structure
In this iteration, an initial structure is set up for the recipe collection. An `index.html` file is created with basic HTML boilerplate code. The file includes an `<h1>` heading with the title ["Odin Recipes."](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes)

## Iteration 2: Recipe Page
The second iteration focuses on creating a recipe page template. A new directory named "recipes" is created within the project directory. Inside this directory, an HTML file is created for each recipe, named after the dish it contains. For example, `lasagna.html` can be used as a template for a lasagna recipe.

The `index.html` file is updated to include links to the recipe pages. Each recipe link is added under the ["Odin Recipes"](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) heading using the `<a>` tag.

## Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content
In this iteration, the recipe pages are enhanced with more content. Each recipe page should include the following:

- An image of the finished dish.
- A "Description" heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe.
- An "Ingredients" heading followed by an unordered list of the ingredients needed for the recipe.
- A "Steps" heading followed by an ordered list of the steps needed to make the dish.

## Iteration 4: Add More Recipes
The final iteration involves adding two more recipes to the collection. These recipes should follow the same page structure as the existing recipe page. The `index.html` file should be updated to include links to the newly added recipes. Consider using an unordered list to organize the recipe links and prevent them from appearing on a single line.

Once the project is completed, the following skills will be demonstrated:

- Creating a basic HTML structure.
- Linking between pages using HTML.
- Adding and displaying images.
- Structuring content with headings and paragraphs.
- Creating lists for ingredients and steps.
- Organizing content within directories.

This project provides a foundation for building a more advanced recipe collection, with the possibility of adding additional features such as search functionality, responsive design, and interactive elements.
