<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Presenting a delectable variation of the classic chateaubriand, this mouthwatering beef Wellington features a delightful twist. Instead of beef tenderloin, we incorporate a blend of 90% lean ground beef and finely minced mushrooms. This ingenious combination not only reduces unnecessary fat but also introduces a sensational umami flavor profile courtesy of the mushrooms.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>5 ounces button mushrooms, coarsely chopped</li>
  <li>12 ounces portobello mushrooms, coarsely chopped</li>
  <li>1 pound 90% lean ground beef</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons panko bread crumbs</li>
  <li>1 large egg</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme, divided</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
  <li>1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
  <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
  <li>2 shallots</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons sherry</li>
  <li>1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
  <li>4 slices prosciutto</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
  <li>1 large egg yolk, beaten</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Combine button mushrooms and portobello mushrooms in a food processor and process until finely ground and they resemble ground beef. Place 5 ounces processed mushrooms in a large bowl; set remaining 12 ounces mushrooms aside for mushroom duxelles.</li>
  <li>Add ground beef, panko, egg, Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 teaspoon thyme, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper to the bowl with the 5 ounces of mushrooms. Mix with your hands or a spoon until well combined. Turn beef mixture out onto a piece of wax paper, and shape into a 5x10-inch rectangular loaf.</li>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, and place an elevated wire rack onto the baking sheet.</li>
  <li>Place 2 shallots into the same food processor and pulse until finely chopped.</li>
  <li>Unfold a sheet of puff pastry. Puff pastry comes folded in thirds; cut off one of the short ends at the 1/3 mark, and reserve to make lattice (optional). Roll out the larger piece of puff pastry on a lightly-floured surface into a 13x15-inch rectangle, which will be large enough to wrap the beef loaf on all sides.</li>
  <li>Leaving a 1-inch border uncovered, place prosciutto slices, slightly overlapping, evenly onto the puff pastry to cover. Spread mustard evenly over prosciutto. Spread mushroom duxelles evenly over mustard layer.</li>
  <li>Spoon a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layering process until all the ingredients are used, ending with a layer of meat sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
  <li>Optional lattice: roll out the reserved 1/3 sheet puff pastry on a lightly floured surface. Using a lattice cutter or a sharp paring knife, cut approximately 1-inch slits in the puff pastry in parallel lines about 1 inch apart, with each line of cuts offset from the adjacent line of cuts by about 1/2 inch. Gently spread the lattice-cut pastry and place over the top of pastry-wrapped loaf. Brush lattice with remaining beaten egg yolk.</li>
  <li>Place pastry-wrapped loaf on the rack on top of the prepared baking sheet.</li>
  <li>Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C), 30 to 45 minutes. Allow to rest for 10 minutes before slicing with a serrated knife.</li>
