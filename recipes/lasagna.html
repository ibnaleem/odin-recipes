<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lasagne, a classic Italian dish, is a delectable layered pasta casserole that boasts a harmonious combination of flavors and textures. The recipe begins by delicately preparing thin sheets of pasta, which serve as the foundation for the dish. These tender pasta sheets are then carefully layered with a variety of succulent fillings, such as rich meaty ragù, velvety béchamel sauce, and a generous sprinkle of grated cheese. Each layer contributes to the overall depth and complexity of the dish, creating a symphony of taste with every bite. The lasagne is then baked to perfection, allowing the flavors to meld together and the top to develop a tantalizing golden-brown crust. When served piping hot, lasagne presents a satisfying medley of savory flavors, luscious textures, and an irresistible aroma that beckons you to indulge in its comforting embrace.</p>
