<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Definitely use very large shrimp for this shrimp oreganata recipe. Think shrimp scampi meets a crunchy baked Parmesan topping. You can serve them as an appetizer, on top of cooked pasta with extra lemon-butter sauce, or simply with some grilled bread and flavorful olive oil to dip in.</p>
